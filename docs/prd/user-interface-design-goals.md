# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A desktop-first, visually elegant interface that transforms task management from a text-heavy chore into an engaging, relationship-aware experience. The interface should feel like a hybrid between a professional productivity tool and an interactive knowledge graph, where users can seamlessly flow between focused task work and broader project awareness. Visual appeal must serve functional needs while maintaining the speed of access to priority items that daily usage demands.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Click-through Navigation**: Direct clicking on visual elements (tags, nodes, tasks) as the primary navigation method
- **Multi-Modal Views**: Smooth transitions between network graph visualization, filtered list views, and individual task details
- **Keyboard-First Efficiency**: Full keyboard shortcuts for power users while maintaining mouse/touch accessibility
- **Visual Scanning**: Color-coded tagging and visual indicators that allow rapid cognitive processing of task states and relationships
- **Contextual Filtering**: Tag-based filtering that maintains breadcrumb navigation and clear escape paths

## Core Screens and Views
- **Dashboard/Home View**: Combined priority task list with network graph overview panel
- **Network Graph View**: Full-screen interactive visualization of task-tag relationships with zoom and navigation controls
- **Filtered Task List View**: Clean list display when clicking tags, with clear filtering indicators and navigation breadcrumbs
- **Task Detail/Edit View**: Individual task creation and editing with tag assignment interface
- **Tag Management View**: Color assignment, tag creation, and organization interface

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensuring keyboard navigation for all interactive elements, sufficient color contrast for tag coding, screen reader compatibility for task content, and alternative navigation paths for users who cannot interact with graph visualizations.

## Branding
Clean, modern interface aesthetic inspired by knowledge management tools like Obsidian but optimized for task-focused productivity. Color palette should support both functional tag coding and visual appeal. Minimal, distraction-free design that lets content and relationships take center stage.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Desktop-first responsive web application optimizing for 1920x1080+ screens with full keyboard support, while ensuring touch-friendly interaction on tablets and mobile devices. Network graph interactions must work smoothly across input methods.
