## UX Expert Prompt

Review the Django To-Do App PRD with focus on UI/UX requirements and create detailed design specifications. Key priorities: (1) Design the network graph visualization interface for optimal user navigation and relationship discovery, (2) Create responsive layouts that work seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, (3) Design the hybrid tag creation workflow to support both planned and organic tagging approaches, (4) Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance throughout all interfaces. The PRD provides comprehensive UI goals and interaction paradigms as your foundation.

## Architect Prompt

Analyze the Django To-Do App PRD and create comprehensive technical architecture. Focus on: (1) Design database schema optimized for tag relationships and network graph queries with PostgreSQL, (2) Plan Django app structure (tasks, tags, visualization) with proper model relationships and API patterns, (3) Evaluate and recommend JavaScript visualization library (D3.js vs vis.js) based on performance requirements and mobile compatibility, (4) Create deployment architecture for PythonAnywhere hosting with performance monitoring and scaling considerations. The PRD includes detailed technical assumptions and constraints to guide your decisions.
