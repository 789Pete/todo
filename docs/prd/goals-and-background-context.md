# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver a next-generation Django-based to-do application that combines traditional task management with innovative visual organization systems
- Provide network-based tag visualization inspired by Obsidian for showing task relationships and patterns
- Enable hybrid tag creation workflows supporting both pre-planned and organic tagging approaches
- Create multi-modal navigation allowing smooth transitions between graph view, filtered lists, and individual tasks
- Achieve 1,000 active users within 6 months with 70% monthly retention rate
- Complete MVP within 8 weeks using Django best practices and architecture
- Enable users to complete 15% more tasks compared to their previous task management system
- Deliver average session length increases indicating deeper user engagement with visual organization features

## Background Context

Current to-do applications fall into two problematic categories: overly simplistic apps that lack organization power, or complex project management tools that overwhelm individual users. The market lacks a to-do application that provides Obsidian-style relationship visualization while maintaining the simplicity and speed that individual productivity requires. Users struggle with limited organization in basic apps, visual cognitive load from text-heavy interfaces, rigid categorization that doesn't adapt to organic workflows, poor navigation flow that breaks concentration, and lack of temporal context in static organization systems.

This PRD addresses these gaps by defining a Django-based solution featuring visual relationship mapping through network graphs, hybrid tag creation supporting different working styles, and priority-first design where advanced features enhance rather than complicate core task management. The target users are knowledge workers and creatives (ages 25-45) who manage 20-100+ ongoing tasks across multiple projects, along with small team coordinators who need both personal organization and team coordination capabilities.
